//! Easily export your Rust types to other languages
//!
//! Specta provides a system for type introspection and a set of language exporter which allows you to export your Rust types to other languages! Currently we support exporting to [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and have alpha support for [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org).
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```rust
//! use specta::*;
//!
//! #[derive(Type)]
//! pub struct MyCustomType {
//!    pub my_field: String,
//! }
//!
//! #[specta]
//! fn some_function(name: String, age: i32) -> bool {
//!     true
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     assert_eq!(
//!         ts::export::<MyCustomType>(),
//!         Ok("export type MyCustomType = { my_field: string }".to_string())
//!         
//!     );
//!
//!      // This API is pretty new and will likely under go API changes in the future.
//!      assert_eq!(
//!         ts::export_datatype(&fn_datatype!(some_function).into()),
//!         Ok("export type FunctionDataType = { name: \"some_function\", input: { name: string, age: number }, result: boolean }".to_string())
//!      );
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why not ts-rs?
//!
//! ts-rs is a great library,
//! but it has a few limitations which became a problem when I was building [rspc](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/rspc).
//! Namely it deals with types individually which means it is not possible to export a type and all of the other types it depends on.
//!
//! ## Supported Libraries
//!
//! If you are using [Prisma Client Rust](https://prisma.brendonovich.dev) you can enable the `rspc` feature on it to allow for Specta support on types coming directly from your database. This includes support for the types created via a selection.
//!

/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use specta::Type;
///
/// // Use it on structs
/// #[derive(Type)]
/// pub struct MyCustomStruct {
///     pub name: String,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Type)]
/// pub struct MyCustomStruct2(String, i32, bool);
///
/// // Use it on enums
/// #[derive(Type)]
/// pub enum MyCustomType {
///     VariantOne,
///     VariantTwo(String, i32),
///     VariantThree { name: String, age: i32 },
/// }
/// ```
pub use specta_macros::Type;

#[doc(hidden)]
/// This macro is exposed from rspc as a wrapper around [Type] with a correct import path.
/// This is exposed from here so rspc doesn't need a macro package for 4 lines of code.
pub use specta_macros::RSPCType;

/// Generates a From implementation for [`DataType`] of the given type.
/// This differs from [`Type`] in that you can use other [`DataType`] values
/// at runtime inside the targeted type, providing an easy way to construct types at
/// runtime from other types which are known statically via [`Type`].
///
/// Along with inner data types such as [`ObjectType`] and [`EnumType`], some builtin types
/// implement `From for DataType`:
/// - [`Vec`] will become [`DataType::Enum`]
/// - [`Option`] will become the value it contains or [`LiteralType::None`] if it is [`None`]
/// - [`String`] and [`&str`] will become [`LiteralType::String`]
///
/// This is an advanced feature and should only be of use to library authors.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use specta::{DataTypeFrom, ts};
///
/// #[derive(DataTypeFrom)]
/// pub struct MyEnum(pub Vec<String>);
///
/// let e = MyEnum(vec![
///     "A".to_string(),
///     "B".to_string(),
/// ]);
///
/// assert_eq!(
///     ts::export_datatype(&e.into()).unwrap(),
///     "export type MyEnum = \"A\" | \"B\""
/// );
/// ```
///
pub use specta_macros::DataTypeFrom;

/// Attribute macro which can be put on a Rust function to introspect its types.
///
/// ```rust
/// #[specta::specta]
/// fn my_function(arg1: i32, arg2: bool) -> &'static str {
///     "Hello World"
/// }
/// ```
